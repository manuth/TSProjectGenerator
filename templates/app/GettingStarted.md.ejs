# Welcome to your TypeScript Generator

This workspace allows you to easilly create yeoman generators written in TypeScript.

## What's in the folder?
<% if (HasCodeWorkspace) { %>
- `.vscode`  
  This folder contains settings and build-task configurations for VSCode.<%
%><% } %>
- `src`  
  This is where you program your module in TypeScript.  
  The TypeScript-Compiler is configured to use this folder as the root of your source-code.
  - `src/generators`
    This folder holds the generators written in TypeScript.
- `lib`  
  The `lib`-folder is the one where your compiled `.js`-files are written to.
- `tsconfig.json`  
  This is the file where the compiler-options are configured.

  This file mostly holds rules for your coding-style.

## Working with the Library

### Creating a Generator

Generators are made by creating a directory,
for example `test`, inside `src/generators`.  
Inside this newly created directory, place a new `index.ts`-file
and let it export a class which inherits the `Generator` class
which you can import from the `@manuth/extended-yo-generator` module.

***Example:***
```ts
import { Generator } from "@manuth/extended-yo-generator";

export = class MyGenerator extends Generator
{
    // [...]
}
```

You can invoke your newly created generator by specifying its name as a sub-command:

```
yo <%= ID %>:test
```
<% if (HasSubGenerator) { %>
There is an example sub-generator located at `<%= SubGeneratorPath %>`, btw.
<% } %><%
%><% if (HasGenerator) { %>
### Checking out the Example Generator

In your `src/generators/app` directory you can find an example generator.
Check it out in order to learn how to make use of the `@manuth/extended-yo-generator` module.
<% } else { %>
### Creating a Main Generator

The main generator always is located at `src/generators/app`.  
It is invoked when no subcommand is specified.
(e.g. when running `yo <%= ID %>` instead of `yo <%= ID %>:test`)

The generator is created as explained in the
[Creating a Generator](#creating-a-generator) section.
<% } %>
### Editing Generators

Use the IntelliSense of your TypeScript-editor for getting
more information about the different useful class members such as following:

- The `TemplateRoot`-member allows you to specify
  a path to the templates relative to the `templates/`-directory
- The `Components`-member allows you to specify
  components users can optionally choose to install
- The `Questions`-member contains questions users
  are prompted to answer during the execution of `Generator.prompting()`

### Testing the Generator
<% if (HasCodeWorkspace) { %>
#### Using Visual Studio Code

You can test the generator in Visual Studio Code
by running the `Launch Yeoman`-Debug configuration.  
This project also supports Unit-Tests using `mocha`.
You can run them using the `Launch Tests`-configuration.
<% } %>
#### Using the Command Prompt

First you need to create a symbolic link of
your project in the global `node_modules`-directory.  
You can do this by invoking following command:

```bash
npm link
```

This can be undone using its counterpart:

```bash
npm unlink
```

Before you can use your generator
you must transpile the TypeScript-code to JavaScript.  
Doing this is as simple as:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or - if you want to clean the output-directory before transpiling the code:

```bash
npm run rebuild
```

You can then run your generator by invoking<%
%><% if (HasSubGenerator) { %><%
%> either one of these commands:

```bash
npx yo <%= ID %>
npx yo <%= ID %>:<%= SubGeneratorName %>
```<%
%><% } else { %><%
%> following command:

```bash
npx yo <%= ID %>
```<%
%><% } %>
